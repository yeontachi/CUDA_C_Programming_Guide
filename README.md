# CUDA C++ Programming Guide Study

> Learning CUDA step-by-step following **NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide (Release 13.0, Sep 02, 2025)**  
> Focused on understanding **GPU architecture**, **CUDA programming model**, and **efficient parallel computation** through conceptual summaries and code implementations.

## Overview
This repository is a personal study project based on the official **NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide (Release 13.0)**.  
Each chapter is reinterpreted with explanations aligned to **GPU hardware behavior** — including warps, blocks, grids, memory hierarchy, and performance optimization.

The goal is to:
- Build a strong conceptual foundation of **CUDA C/C++**.
- Understand how **GPU threads** execute and synchronize.
- Reproduce and explain core code examples from the guide.
- Implement small experiments to visualize GPU operations.
